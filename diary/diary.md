Today I set up the vimwiki system for the first time. I don't think it will 
entirely replace the way I take notes (mostly in CherryTree right now), but it will be 
a good escuse to use vim more, even when I'm writing other stuff.

I need to practice my vim right now, and also to integrate all the various shortcuts that
vim brings into the workflow, especially considering that plugins alone have a good deal
of very specific keybindings. Right now I feel kind of overwhelmed and I need to try to
focus on just using the ones that I have, until they become second nature and I would be
then able to incorporate even more. Right now is kind of a struggle to remember all the 
shortcuts I need.
